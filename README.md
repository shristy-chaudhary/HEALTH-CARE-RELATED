The challenge is to create a model that, using data from ad server logs, can determine whether a user falls under the category of Healthcare Professionals (HCP). If the HCP falls within that group, the model should also be able to forecast their taxonomy or area of specialisation.Ad server logs, which include fields such device type, platform ID, IP address, user ID, user city, ZIP code, user agent (browser specifics), platform type, channel type, URL, keywords, taxonomy, and a flag indicating whether or not the user is an HCP, make up the input data.�Objective:The goal is to develop a model that can reliably distinguish between HCP and non-HCP users and forecast the specialisation (taxonomy) for HCP users. The model must offer two different kinds of solutions:

Solution for Scoring: The model must produce an output file with parameters that match those in the supplied data dictionary. The scoring logic will be applied to this output file.

Complete Solution: The model should include the taxonomy field in the output file for HCP users in addition to the score solution.The model will be judged on its accuracy in classifying HCP users according to their individual specialties (taxonomy).

image Solution proposed: The suggested approach uses a Random Forest Classifier model to predict Healthcare Professionals' (HCP) taxonomy from ad server logs and reliably identify HCPs. The model will make use of a variety of methods, including data preprocessing, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and forecasting test data.��Description:�The following actions are required for the solution:

Use pandas to load the train and test data.

Remove the 'TAXONOMY' column from the train data since it is not necessary for model training.

Scan the train data for missing values and remove any rows that contain them.

Divide the train data into X and Y values

Use SimpleImputer to fill in any missing variables

Apply OneHotEncoder to categorical variables.

Set the number of estimators in a Random Forest Classifier to 100.

Use SimpleImputer to find missing values in the test data and fill them in.

Use OneHotEncoder to encode categorical variables in the test data.

Use the learned Random Forest Classifier to make predictions about test data.

Make a dataframe containing the forecasts and user ids.

If "IS_HCP" is 1, look for the term in the "KEYWORDS" column and print it in "TAXONOMY.“

Read the output CSV file after saving the output to a CSV file.14) Calculate the accuracy score using the evaluation metric—the macro f1 score—and contrast it with the one that has been provided.

A Random Forest Classifier, a potent ensemble learning method that mixes various decision trees to create predictions, is used in the suggested approach. It is capable of handling non-linear correlations between features and is efficient in handling missing values and categorical variables. After being trained on training data, the model then uses test data to make predictions. A dataframe containing the user ids and the predictions is then made using the predictions. If 'IS_HCP' is 1, the 'KEYWORDS' column is then searched for the keyword and printed in 'TAXONOMY'. The output is then saved to a CSV file, and the evaluation metric is used to determine the accuracy score.!

1)Use pandas to load the train and test data into the programme: The first step is to use pandas to load the train and test data into the programme. The pandas library is a well-liked option for data science projects since it offers strong tools for data manipulation and analysis.

2)Preprocessing of the data is the subsequent stage: This include determining whether any values are missing, handling categorical variables, and scaling the data as necessary. Since it is not necessary for training the model in this project, the 'TAXONOMY' column is removed from the train data. Additionally, we look for missing values in the train data and remove any rows that have them. OneHotEncoder is used to encode categorical variables in the train and test datasets.

3) Training the model: Training the model is the next phase. In this research, we analyse ad server logs to identify Healthcare Professionals (HCP) and predict their taxonomy using a Random Forest Classifier model. A potent ensemble learning technique called the Random Forest Classifier mixes different decision trees to produce predictions. The encoded categorical variables are used to train the model using the train data.

4)Making predictions based on test data: After the model has been trained, predictions are made based on the test data. Similar to how the train data was preprocessed, the test data also handled missing values and encoded categorical variables. On the basis of the test data, predictions are then made using the trained.

5)model.Creating the output dataframe: A dataframe containing the user ids and the predicted values is created using the predicted values. If 'IS_HCP' is 1, the 'KEYWORDS' column is then searched for the keyword and printed in 'TAXONOMY'. The output is then saved to a CSV file, and the evaluation metric is used to determine the accuracy score.

6)Evaluation: The macro f1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall on a per-class basis and where the classes are the distinct specialties (taxonomies) of HCP users, is used to assess the model's accuracy. The efficiency of the model is assessed by contrasting the accuracy score with the specified evaluation metric.

In general, the method entails preprocessing the data, training the model, making predictions based on test data, and assessing the model's precision. Since the Random Forest Classifier model can deal with missing data, categorical variables, and non-linear connections between features, it is a good fit for this project.
